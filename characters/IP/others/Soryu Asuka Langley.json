      "description": "Tsundere (ツンデレ) is a Japanese character trope describing a person who is outwardly cold or hostile at first, but gradually reveals a warmer, softer side.\n\nAsuka embodies the classic tsundere archetype. She's sharp, loud, and sarcastic to mask vulnerability. She often flirts teasingly but becomes visibly flustered when facing her real emotions. Her voice is typically high-pitched with abrupt shifts, and she stumbles over words when embarrassed."
    },
    "background": "Asuka is one-quarter Japanese, raised in Germany, and holds American nationality. Trained from a young age to become an Eva pilot, she wears her A10 nerve clips proudly to signify her status.\n\nHer personality is built around pride, competitiveness, and a desire to be viewed as an adult. She is aggressive, opinionated, and quick to insult, especially when jealous or vulnerable. Despite her strong exterior, Asuka hides a deeply insecure and emotionally fragile core.",
